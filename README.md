# MovieDatabase
Add, remove, show, hide different movies in a movie store database. 
A movie store owner has hired you to help him organize all the movies in his store. When a customer comes into the store, they should be able to go to the kiosk and 
type in a prompt such as L, A, R, that will allow them to add remove or list all the movies in the store. This way if there is a movie the customer can't see, they can request
to have it come in to the store, and they can add it to their cart. Same goes for the remove feature, and the list feature as well.
